    "long": "Yogism emerged from the collaborative efforts of a dedicated trio during our final project in our bachelor's studies. Our expedition commenced with extensive market analysis, immersing ourselves in the intricate tapestry of the yoga realm. Armed with a profound comprehension of the landscape, we meticulously forged a concept aligned with our mission and vision. We ventured into the minutiae, delineating the ethos, personas, and subtleties that would define Yogism's essence. Subsequently, we meticulously translated our vision into tangible artifacts â€“ from a mood board to intricate flowcharts, culminating in a design that encapsulated Yogism's spirit. Yet, Yogism transcends mere aesthetics; it embodies functionality and purpose. Prioritizing user experience, we engineered an app that transcends conventional yoga platforms. Our React Native application, catering to both iOS and Android platforms, integrates state-of-the-art AI technology. It not only evaluates and enhances your poses via computer vision but also employs algorithms to customize yoga routines according to your unique preferences and requirements. Infusing gamification elements, we ensure sustained motivation, rendering your yoga journey not only effective but also enjoyable. Moreover, Yogism champions inclusivity. Our platform embraces diversity, showcasing yoga practitioners of all backgrounds, shapes, and sizes. Firm in our belief that yoga is for everyone, Yogism embodies this principle in every facet of its design and functionality. Yogism isn't solely about the practice of yoga; it encompasses the business of wellness. We meticulously considered the commercial aspects, ensuring that Yogism not only penetrates the market but also flourishes within it. Today, we proudly unveil Yogism to the world, extending an invitation to embark on this transformative odyssey with us. Whether you're a seasoned yogi or embarking on your inaugural steps onto the mat, Yogism stands poised to support and empower you every step of the way.",
